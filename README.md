# Liz
Liz is an AI program I wrote using speechsynthesis 

Liz uses the Annyang speech regonition library for the speech regonition and SpeechKITT for program commands such as abort and and start.

<strong>here is a version of the program that will run in most browsers, I would recomend Google Chrome.</strong> (the only reason I say chrome is becuase I know it works on that platform):
