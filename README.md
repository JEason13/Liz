# Liz
Liz is an AI program I wrote using speechsynthesis 

<strong>Here is a version of the program that will run in most browsers, I would recomend Google Chrome.</strong> (the only reason I say chrome is becuase I know it works on that platform):

Liz can talk to you via computer or external mic, and can remember some things like you name which your tell it as input before the rest of the code runs. 

just so you know the voice verries on different operating systems eg. male on MacOS and female on WindowsOS.
